# mern-stack-01

First full project with MERN stack, using concepts such as routes, controllers, database models to create the Backend API and consuming it from a React Frontend.

## Used Modules:

* Express
* Mongoose (Javascript's ORM for MongoDB)
* Dotenv (Environment variable management)
* Cors (Simple Cors configuration to allowing Backend server access from Frontend)
* Nodemon (Development tool to make server automatically refresh on file changes)

## Credits:

This project is based on a video of the youtube chanel "Fazt Code" but it'll be sightly modified to match my preferences. The main objective is to practice and understand some concepts of web application development.
